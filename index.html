            [8 Jul Update: Red Dot United has just released a 16 page <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13A1g7G-KeK-XyLTzQvNxZthqsRPrauUp/view" target="blank">Green Charter</a>. Though we don’t have the time to score it, we encourage you to study it in detail especially if they are one of your candidates!]
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>The climate crisis will be the defining crisis of our generation.</b> To truly emerge stronger from the pandemic, we cannot go back to normal. A green and just recovery is the only way to secure a better and fairer society for all of us. Our scorecard summarises each party’s stances on the various issues in our Policy Brief, to provide voters with a guide for the upcoming elections. Each party was scored according to its capacity for action on a scale of -90 to +90: the PAP (+8), on the policies it has implemented; the WP (+14), on its Parliamentary speeches and questions; the SDP (+16), on its climate and other policy papers.
            <br>
            <br>
            The <b>PAP Government</b> scored well in the transport, adaptation, and buildings sections  due to their clear, well articulated plans in these domains. In contrast, the <b>WP and SDP</b> scored well in the collective action section, owing to significant contributions from both parties towards strengthening democracy and encouraging public participation. For championing expanded social welfare policies, they also scored well in the equity section. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>All parties have significant areas for improvement, especially their positions on the fossil fuel industry.</b> The PAP was penalised heavily for their clear, continued support for expanding the role of fossil fuels in Singapore. The WP, on the other hand, has no clear stand on the fossil fuel industry. While the SDP has criticised the close ties between the state and Big Oil, it needs clear plans in order to back up its statements of intent.
            <br>
            <br>
            We look forward to seeing all candidates speak up more about climate issues in the run-up to the elections. As voters, we also play an important role. Join our <a href="http://tinyurl.com/NGWatch" target="blank">Neighbourhood Greenwatch</a> initiative to push your candidates for ambitious climate commitments!

            The <a href="https://www.pap.org.sg/manifesto/" target="blank">PAP</a> has acknowledged climate change as an existential threat to Singapore. In response, it aspires to “game change climate change.” However, its actions have not matched up with its rhetoric. Were all countries to follow the government’s most recent 2030 emissions target, there would be global warming of 3-4ºC. Meeting the government’s 2030 target does not require a major decarbonisation of Singapore's industries and energy supply — the primary sources of local emissions — and is thus inadequate. Though the government scored highly on transport and waste, these sectors contribute relatively less to carbon emissions. While much of the government’s climate policy and spending are focused on adaptation to rising sea levels and food security, it is unclear if these measures will be equitable and targeted to address the needs of disadvantaged communities. On the whole, the government’s policies show a tendency to maintain the status quo. However, its response to the COVID-19 epidemic shows that it is capable of bold action if it chooses to treat the climate crisis like the pressing emergency that it is.

    Since 2011, the Workers’ Party has held 6 elected and 3 non-constituency seats in Parliament. Workers’ Party Members of Parliament (MPs) have used this opportunity to probe the incumbent on stronger environmental and social policies, performing marginally better in overall scoring than the incumbent government. The party performed well in the nature and transport sections because its MPs have consistently raised issues such as conservation, public transport affordability, and electric vehicle infrastructure in parliament, pushing the incumbent to do better in these areas. The party also performed well in collective action, given its long-standing support for transparency and civil discourse. However, the party could have been bolder in many domains, such as climate ambition, energy, industry, and buildings, leading to many gaps in scoring. Furthermore, in spite of its positive contribution in parliament, Greenwatch would like to see the party adopt more ambitious plans in its election manifestos. In its <a href="https://www.wp.sg/manifesto/" target="blank">2020 election manifesto</a>, its only climate pledges were for a 10% renewable energy target and a reduction in single-use plastics. As the largest opposition party, the Workers’ Party can do more to re-center the political discussion on the climate crisis; both in terms of its impacts on vulnerable Singaporeans and the role Singapore plays in creating it.

    In its 2020 <a href="https://yoursdp.org/news/sdp's-young-democrats-push-for-meaningful-and-decisive-action-on-climate-change-in-singapore" target="blank">climate change policy paper</a>, the SDP rightly emphasises the urgency of the climate crisis, acknowledging both the inadequate status quo and need for bolder measures. The SDP has the political will to tackle environmental issues, and for this it attains a marginally higher score than the incumbent government in Greenwatch’s scoring metrics. The SDP did well in the energy, nature and industry categories, where it calls out the continued support for the extractive fossil fuel and palm oil sectors, and points to the need to expand access to renewable energy. The party also scored well in the collective action and equity categories, owing to its longstanding support for civil society and its advocacy of expanded social welfare policies. However, the party often fell short when it came to the details of their proposals. For example, even though the party said it would “significantly upgrade” Singapore’s pledge under the Paris Agreement, no specific figure was given. In contrast, the current government has put forth an updated target in 2020.
 However, the SDP should be cautious in linking the population issue with climate change, as this has deep historical linkages with the xenophobic politics of the far right. While the party has explicitly said that it opposes xenophobic discourses, Greenwatch would like to see further assurances that the party does not step down this path.

    The Singapore People’s Party (SPP) features “Combating the climate emergency” as one of 10 sections in its GE 2020 manifesto for <a href="https://singaporepeoplesparty.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Manifesto_Full.pdf" target="blank">“A Better Tomorrow”</a>. It argues that Singapore should lead global efforts against climate change, and is one of only two parties to explicitly support divestment of fossil fuels by calling for a roadmap for SGX-listed companies to divest from carbon-intensive operations, as well as the only one to call for mandatory environmental impact assessments near nature reserves, with all reports made publicly available. However, the manifesto is brief and does not cover many other topics such as energy, climate ambition, transport and adaptation. SPP has also not spoken up on these issues prior to the release of its manifesto on 28 June. Greenwatch would like to see SPP speak up on these issues beyond its campaign, and expand its list of policy proposals so as to further recognise how multi-faceted combating the climate crisis must be.

    The <a href="http://reform.sg/green-manifesto/" target="blank">Reform Party</a> released a separate Green Manifesto on 1 Jul after Nomination Day, leaving us without sufficient time to seek clarifications. Though it mentions strong points such as a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 and a whole-of-government “Response to Climate Change Act” to support it, we also note that many of the points in the manifesto seem to be directly taken from our Greenwatch Policy Brief with no further elaboration despite the seemingly strong ambition. The Greenwatch team would like to see the Reform Party speaking up on these issues in greater detail.

                        <p>Ahead of the coming general election, the Greenwatch team hopes that the climate crisis will be seen by political parties and voters alike with the seriousness that it deserves. To serve as a guide on climate policies, we have prepared our own Climate Scorecard, a tool to measure the ambition each party shows in their manifestos and campaigns to tackle climate change. We aim for this to benefit both parties and voters. For parties, we hope that our scorecard can be a useful framework to ensure that policies address the many dimensions of climate change. For voters, we hope that this can be a helpful guide in understanding what is at stake with climate change, and where each party stands.

                    <h3 class="title is-4">Green Transition</h3>
                    <p>The green transition demands that we think seriously about how we live with each other and how
                        our world is interconnected. The climate crisis is not just an environmental problem, but it is a problem borne out of years
                        of unequal relationships; with our planet and also, with one another. Conducting extractive activities on the land of vulnerable
                        communities to satiate our greed for fossil fuel energy is an apt example of how the climate crisis is built on the extensive exploitation of our earth and people. This transition will allow us to reflect on histories upon histories of social, political and economic injustices and oppression. It will allow us to reexamine our priorities, how our focus on economic growth has caused the planet to suffer and how unjust our societies have become because we did not value the wellbeing of all. And it will also allow us to realise a net-zero carbon society, with mass adoption of renewable energy, and a world under 1.5 degrees of warming. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The green transition must be one premised on equity, collaboration and compassion. Policies for the green transition must be structural in nature and must move us towards transforming all facets of government and society. This will ensure that future generations will have a much fairer world to live in. The government must also allow for more citizen engagement and must take into account the voices of all citizens, including the ones who may be currently kept out of conversations due to socio-political and cultural barriers; the policy-making process must be more accessible and transparent. Finally, the green transition must also acknowledge the rights of various environmental entities—natural spaces, ecosystems, and individual species—that share this earth with us.

                        <p>Greenwatch is a politically nonpartisan campaign. Our scoring is meant to reflect Greenwatch’s assessment of each party’s policies based on our environmental criteria, which draws upon and applies the recommendations of IPCC and other renowned climate science to Singapore’s context.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We have created a scale from -3 to +3 to evaluate each party’s policies in relation to our policy brief. A positive score means that the party has entirely, substantially or partially met our ask(s). A score of NA means that there is insufficient information to score the party on that environmental criteria. A negative score means either that (a) the party might have made positive commitments, but we have considerable doubt or concerns about the legitimacy of these commitments or (b) that the party has either actively committed to or passively supported policy actions that lead to more carbon emissions and exacerbate the climate crisis.

The parties scored +8, +13, and +16 respectively, on a scale of -90 to +90. This summary will highlight key differences between the parties’ scores in the 11 sub-sections.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While Climate Scorecards in other countries may assess parties on equal footing, Greenwatch recognises the asymmetrical quality of Singaporean politics. Each party was largely scored according to its capacity for action: the PAP government, on the policies it has implemented; the WP, on its Parliamentary speeches and questions; the SDP, which did not have the opportunity to do either, was scored on its 40-page climate policy paper. Additionally, the Scorecard considered statements made by politicians from all the parties, due to the dearth of climate considerations on all three parties’ official platforms.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The PAP Government scored well in the transport, adaptation, and buildings sections. This was due to their clear, well articulated plans for greater investment in public transport, climate mitigation infrastructure, and also waste reduction. In contrast, the two opposition parties scored well in the collective action section, owing to significant contributions from both parties towards strengthening democracy and encouraging public participation. For championing expanded social welfare policies, they also scored well in the equity section. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        All three parties have significant areas for improvement, the biggest being their respective positions on the fossil fuel industry. The PAP was penalised heavily for their clear, continued support in expanding the role of fossil fuels in Singapore. The WP, on the other hand, has no clear stand on the fossil fuel industry. This might be interpreted as tacit support for the status quo set by the PAP government, and can only change when the party clarifies its position. Lastly, the SDP fared much better than both parties, having criticised the close ties between the state and Big Oil. However, it needs to have a clear plan on divestment from fossil fuels to back up its statements of intent.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Overall, all three parties have made a promising start on thinking about what is needed to combat the climate crisis, but much more work still needs to be done. Greenwatch hopes that the scorecard will go some way in the three parties with guidelines from which to craft future climate policies.

                            <p>PSP’s <a href="https://psp.org.sg/ge2020-manifesto-by-progress-singapore-party-for-country-for-people/" target="blank">manifesto</a> only made one specific mention of the environment - “Maintain balance between economic development and environmental protection for the sake of future generations” - which is too vague to derive any stance or policy proposal by the party. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                However, they have some policies which may be helpful towards creating greater equity and space for collective action, such as increased workfare and ComCare payouts. In terms of collective action, they have also stressed that their political policies will be guided by “accountability, transparency and independence” and “freedom of speech and expression to weave a richer national fabric”. For the latter, specific policies such as a POFMA review and relaxed regulations of media and the arts are put forth.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                With that being said, the party’s stance on foreign labour may inadvertently be encouraging the rising wave of xenophobia in Singapore. It is unclear how the PSP will deal with this as they have yet to confront this issue.

                            <p>Though they have yet to release a manifesto, People’s Voice has definitely spoken out on climate change. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FuIq9wrLIo" target="blank">In a video</a> posted last year, Lim Tean questioned if Singapore’s current policies to mitigate climate change, such as their IPCC agreement, were actually enough. He also criticised their then-lack of implementation for EVs and expansion of Seletar Airport for private jets. Lim also spoke about Singapore’s ties to major oil corporations and the fossil fuel industry, suggesting a shift towards renewable energy and making solar panels mandatory on buildings.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                However, PV’s response to the climate issue has its own problems as well. In that same video, Lim criticized the implementation of a carbon tax by saying the “carbon tax is not necessarily going to make a country more carbon friendly”, without taking into account the impacts a carbon tax can indeed make on emissions if implemented fairly and correctly. Furthermore, PV is dangerously close to exhibiting eco-nationalist policies, having been heavily nationalistic in their proposals against <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXdMfeVeN8" target="blank">migrant workers</a> in this video blurred by the cameraman’s finger. They must ensure that their form of climate action does not discriminate and create a tough situation for those already underprivileged in society.

                                Lastly, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesVoiceSingapore/photos/climate-change-is-nothing-but-a-distraction-ploy-by-the-pap-government-masagos-s/2350891621845697/" target="blank">the party put out a headline</a> that said “Climate Change Is Nothing But A Distraction Ploy By The PAP Government!”.

                            <p>In their <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11T6lyeY0Xf4I_eB1LcuJJgs6RhKQMsWJ/edit" target="blank">2020 manifesto</a>, the NSP failed to account for climate change and has not made any comments about climate change in the past. Thus, we are unsure of their stance towards climate action, and the lack of the slightest mention of the issue is worrying.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Some of their policy points do promote a better space for collective (environmental) action though, such as the call to review and abolish POFMA while also questioning the Internal Security Act. Furthermore, they have called for transparency regarding the details of new HDB projects to allow evaluation of their cost efficiency. While environmental considerations were not mentioned, this could open the door for greater transparency towards Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for new building projects.

In a <a href="https://youtu.be/IcCARVoYS0o?t=528" target="blank">20 Answers With... video</a> posted by MothershipSG, SDA’s leader Desmond Lim spoke briefly about how Singapore was at risk due to rising sea levels. He suggested that Singapore could take on more efforts in recycling and encouraging people to use less plastic. Beyond that, there has been no other explicit mention of environmental issues.

                                The SDA also advocates for a 'Singaporean First' policy, connecting lax immigration policies with a lack of jobs for Singaporeans. Although they acknowledge that foreigners are good for Singapore, the SDA should be cautious about the potential slide into xenophobic politics.

                            <p>While <a href="https://reddotunited.sg/latest/f/a-charter-for-our-future---captains-of-our-own-lives" target="blank">Red Dot United (RDU)</a> has <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/red-dot-united-to-push-for-changes-in-housing-job-policies" target="blank">expressed</a> that it will be “advocating for policies that will help prepare Singapore for the future, in areas such as climate change and population growth”, the party’s approach appears largely incremental and it lacks a plan that goes beyond identifying particular areas for improvement. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Climate policy: RDU devoted a small section of their manifesto to climate change and outlined a few ideas, albeit rather vaguely and without much detail, making it difficult to determine if the proposals are different from that of existing policies. The party supports a switch to clean energy, and proposes “exploring the feasibility of solar panels and wind turbines in public spaces” and regional collaboration for renewable energy. They also expressed support for electric vehicles and waste reduction, but did not elaborate more on how this support would translate. For waste, the party mentioned increasing public education in the 3Rs, which is again not dissimilar to existing policies. They have also proposed scaling back rapid deforestation and increasing reforestation, which again lacks sufficient detail. It is also unclear what they mean by “social infrastructure for climate change purposes”. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Collective action: RDU has voiced proposals which can positively affect the space for collective action. Similar to other parties, they have asked for a review of POFMA, ISA and the Public Order Act as well as advocated for a Freedom of Information Act.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Equity: RDU has argued for the government to recognise the value of care work by contributing to these caregivers’ CPF accounts, although this extends only to parents who choose to stay at home to care for their children.

                    <h5>Who are the people involved in grading the climate scorecard, and what are their credentials in the field of environmental science and policy? Were experts in the respective fields or people working in these industries consulted when scoring those categories?</h5>
                    <p>The Greenwatch team consists of people from SG Climate Rally and Speak For Climate. We undertook around 4-5 months of research, poring over policy papers, conversing with government officials and political parties, to obtain a thorough understanding of their climate policies. All facts presented in the government scorecard have been clarified with government agencies as well. Therefore, it is unnecessary to shore up the factual bedrock of our scorecard with our own ‘credentials’.
                        As for the scores themselves, they are entirely the opinion of the Greenwatch team, and we encourage Singaporeans to look at the details for each question in the <a href="http://scorecard.sgclimaterally.com/#climate-Ambition">scorecard</a> and see for themselves the credibility of our justifications. If you believe that there are significant points that we might have overlooked, feel free to contact us at <a href="sg.climaterally@gmail.com" target="blank">sg.climaterally@gmail.com</a>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, in constructing the scoring methodology, we also consulted numerous notable academics in the environmental humanities and sciences, though many of them preferred to remain unnamed. This is because involvement in political activities in Singapore could threaten their livelihoods, an unfortunate reality of the present political climate.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Is politicising climate change the best way to bring attention to the issue? </h5>
                    <p>Climate change is an inherently political issue. Around the world, companies that profit from or contribute to the climate crisis spend millions of dollars lobbying politicians to prevent stronger climate legislation, nationally or internationally; in many countries, fossil fuel industries are closely tied to structures of political power, entrenching their presence. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In Singapore, the de-politicisation of issues like climate change is, in fact, a political action. It privileges status quo understandings of the world and methods of governance, such as technocratic leadership and financial orthodoxy, over others. While these understandings are not inherently bad in all contexts, if left unchallenged they will uphold the existing global fossil fuel-led growth system, as they have for decades. This is the same system that will continue to exacerbate the climate crisis. Therefore, in acknowledging the politics of climate change, we are able to challenge the assumptions that underpin these understandings and methods of governance; only through doing so can the fossil fuel system be gradually drawn down, and a habitable climate preserved.
                        </p>

                    <h5>Are we holding the incumbent (PAP) government to a higher standard than opposition parties, who are able to voice policies that they are not in a position to implement?</h5>
                    <p>We have designed our scorecard to be as comprehensive as possible, covering many different areas of environmental policy. Given this range of scoring categories, it can be expected that not every party, in particular the smaller parties, will have detailed solutions in every area. In such cases, we will give the party aN NA on that particular metric. More well-resourced parties will have more opportunities to score higher if they can come up with good ideas and proposals, but on the flipside they are also liable to more negative scores in areas where status quo policies are detrimental to a habitable climate. We designed our scoring system with this in mind so that we can grade parties with a degree of fairness in view of their relative capacities.  </p>

                    <h5>How can opposition parties help to bring about better outcomes for Singapore, even if they articulate a desire for stronger climate policies?</h5>
                    <p>Even if opposition parties are not in a position to form a government in the next election, they play the critical role of voicing alternative visions to status quo policies. If opposition parties have bolder climate policies with clear support from voters, the incumbent party is forced to respond to win the support of climate-concerned voters. </p>

                    <h5>How can Singapore draw down its fossil fuel industry if the establishment of renewable industries as an alternative is not feasible in Singapore?</h5>
                    <p>One common misconception is that Singapore’s oil refining and petrochemical industry functions primarily to supply energy for Singapore’s power needs. These industries are in fact <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421517301714" target="blank">export-oriented</a> and serve global markets. Decarbonisation requires reshaping these export-oriented sectors to reduce their environmental impacts, as well as a transition towards renewable energy sources for our domestic needs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another point to note is that increasing the share of renewable energy, namely solar, in our energy mix is feasible. A <a href="https://www.eco-business.com/news/solar-could-meet-43-of-singapores-power-demand-during-mid-day-by-2050-study/" target="blank">recent study</a> published by the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and commissioned by the Singapore government has highlighted that with the right mix of policies, Singapore’s solar capacity could grow to 5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2050, up from 350 megawatt-peak (MWp) today. This means that by 2050, solar energy generated locally could meet 43% of electric power demand during mid-day. Furthermore, even if few off-the-shelf solutions are currently suited to Singapore’s context, there remains the potential to use novel and cost-effective urban solar applications.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Regional projects also represent untapped potential. As mentioned in our scorecard, the Singapore government could also deepen its commitments in regional energy projects, for instance through the ASEAN Power Grid or bilateral partnerships such as the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/20b-plan-to-supply-solar-power-from-australia-to-spore" target="blank">Australian-Singapore Power Link</a>, which is projected to supply a fifth of Singapore’s power needs through solar energy.</p>

                    <h5>Are there viable replacements for other important by-products of the petrochemical industry if we remove it or reduce its presence in Singapore?</h5>
                    <p>Non-fuel products of the petrochemical industry include the chemical building blocks for plastics, detergents, adhesive, and  other products, known as synthetic polymers. These synthetic polymers are a small fraction of the yield from a barrel of crude oil; most of the products yielded are various fuels.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some, but not all, of these materials will remain important. On the other hand, Singapore’s emissions will continue rising if we continue to expand the industry. Therefore, we must reconfigure production to retain necessary products while drawing down the industry so that it is no longer geared towards maximising profits at the cost of environmental and human harm. There are ways of making current processes more sustainable - such as by involving a mix of emerging technologies, from using sustainably-sourced chemical feedstocks to capturing carbon emitted as a by-product of industrial processes - but this must be done in tandem with a targeted drawdown of the industry, not an expansion.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ultimately, if a habitable climate is to exist, emissions from the petrochemical industry will have to decline at some point, and preparing for that early by drawing down production, retraining workers, and heavily researching alternatives is the best way forward.

                    <h5>With a carbon tax, won’t corporations simply pass additional costs on to consumers, increasing cost of living without actually reducing emissions?</h5>
                    <p>By putting an appropriate price on carbon emissions, we ensure that the prices of fossil fuels reflect the costs of climate disruption to society, and leverage the capacity of the market to enable emissions reductions. It also signals to polluting companies that their social legitimacy is dwindling. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That said, a large proportion of Singapore’s emissions are in sectors that serve export markets. This means that much of the share of these costs will be borne by corporations, as well as foreign consumers. With a well-designed carbon tax policy, wealth can be transferred from corporations and global consumers to the Singapore budget, which can then be distributed back to the Singapore people.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Greenwatch believes that revenues from carbon taxes should be held in a differentiated fund and progressively redistributed according to residents’ needs as carbon dividends. This arrangement should be instituted into legislation. Such an arrangement would be fundementally different from the current system, which gives households one-off utilities rebates to offset the rise in cost of electricity and gas. These rebates may or may not be drawn from the carbon tax revenues collected. Carbon dividends, on the other hand, give citizens a direct benefit from the carbon tax policy.

                    <h5>How will the government’s transport decarbonisation plan work, given that certain sectors like long distance road vehicles, ships and planes cannot be electrified and will need to rely on internal combustion engines?</h5>
                    <p>The government’s attempts at decarbonisation in land transport focus mainly on last mile transport and moving away from a car-first public transport policy. However, there is room for more measures that reflect the full social cost of car ownership and reclaim car space through people-centric street design.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As for decarbonising the shipping and airline industries, there is still much scientific work to be done. Regarding emissions in these sectors, the government has articulated several policies. Singapore will participate in (1) the voluntary phase of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to freeze carbon footprint, improve energy efficiency and study the use of sustainable aviation fuels, and (2) launch the Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint 2050 next year, placing $40 million under the Maritime GreenFuture Fund. More details on this have yet to be released.

                    <h5>Apart from renewables and divesting from fossil fuels, what are Singapore’s prospects for setting up an economy providing services for carbon sequestration?</h5>
                    <p>The government has said that technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) are one of three key thrusts in its low emissions development strategy, but has not shared further details. The financial and technological viability of such a solution is still being explored. Therefore, a more detailed CCS R&D plan would be immensely helpful to further reduce industrial emissions, which make up 60% of our total emissions.</p>

                    <h5>Will liquid alternative fuels such as biofuels, ammonia and hydrogen also allow the transition of jobs from the petrochemicals to renewable energy industry?</h5>
                    <p>Alternative forms of energy are an important part of the green transition and the shift away from fossil fuels. The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) has mentioned in its Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) that low-carbon hydrogen is an option that the Singapore government is keen on exploring. However, this alternative energy source is still in a nascent stage of development and may not be a viable option in the near term. Nonetheless, it is key that Singapore is proactive in researching and pioneering these alternatives to generate jobs for Singaporeans as the fossil fuel industry continues to decline globally.</p>

                    <h5>How much R&D is the government putting into renewable energy, and should environmental groups also try to influence the private sector to develop the necessary technology?</h5>
                    <p>The government is currently pushing for solar deployment through the SolarNova programme. Additionally, a few private actors have announced large investments into solar energy projects around the region. However, the outcomes of these projects are ultimately based on financial considerations, and the government has indicated that it does not want to “interfere” with market signals in this area.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As much as corporate initiatives are welcome, our green transition must not be dependent on market pressures; the government should take a stronger role in developing this sector, such as through Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), which it has drawn up for other key industries, and the Emerging Stronger Taskforce, that it has set up to provide recommendations for a post-Covid-19 economy. The green transition is no less important.

                    <h5>Is data availability and disclosure an important issue around climate action; has it been evaluated in the Greenwatch scorecard and included in the #AskYourCandidate question list?</h5>
                    <p>While data availability is not specifically mentioned in the scorecard or question list, Greenwatch does consider it a significant issue that overlaps with climate action. Under the ‘collective action’ category, the scorecard asks the following question: “How transparent and open to participation is the government with the public and other civil society groups during its policymaking processes?” The scorecard assigns a score of -1 to this question due to several factors associated with lack of transparency around government data and policy making processes. More information can be found under the ‘details’ tab of this question on the scorecard.</p>

                                    <li>Singapore’s 2020 update to its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), our emissions target, does not change the level of carbon emissions we aim for in 2030. <a href="https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Singapore%20First/Singapore%20INDC.pdf" target="blank">In 2015</a>, Singapore targeted reducing emissions as a factor of GDP by 36% (below 2005 levels), by 2030. At the time, the 2030 target was estimated to be 65 MTCO2e based on projected GDP growth. <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/speeches/speech-by-senior-minister-and-coordinating-minister-for-national-security-teo-chee-hean-committee-of-supply-2020-28-february-2020" target="_blank">In 2020</a>, Singapore targeted an absolute peak emission level of 65 MtCO2e around 2030. The 2015 and 2020 targets are similar.</li>
                                    <li>The updated target of 65 MTCO2e by 2030 is ~28% above <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-inventory" target="blank">2014 emissions</a> of 50.9 MTCO2e. Singapore needs to considerably improve its reduction target.</li>
                                    <li>The second part of the new NDC, which aims to reach half of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/spores-2050-target-halve-emissions-from-2030-peak" target="blank">2030's emissions by 2050</a>, also lacks ambition. Half of 2030 emissions (65 MtCO2e) is 33 MtCO2e, which would mean only a return to 1997 emission levels according to <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/singapore/" target="blank">Climate Action Tracker’s data.</a> In order to keep global warming to within 1.5 degrees celsius, net global emissions <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/" target="blank">need</a> to reach 0 MtCO2e by 2050</li>
                                    <li>There appears to be no desire to meet the IPCC target for 1.5 degree warming. PM Lee Hsien Loong has declared that it is <a href="https://mothership.sg/2020/03/pm-lee-covid-19-interview-transcript/" target="blank">not practical</a> for Singapore to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>In Parliament in 2019, PAP MP Dr Lim Wee Kiak <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/day-2-budget-debate-mps-ask-easy-access-data-and-climate-change-act" target="blank">said</a> that “Singapore should consider enacting a Climate Change Act” which legally binds the country to meeting its climate targets. Countries like <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/tackling-climate-change/the-legal-landscape/the-climate-change-act/" target="blank">Britain</a> and <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/climate-change-act/id2593351/" target="blank">Norway</a> have put in place a Climate Change act; Malaysia has been <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/05/16/yeo-at-least-24-months-for-climate-change-act-to-be-tabled-if-necessary/1753644" target="blank">scoping</a> and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-to-draft-climate-change-act-formulate-national-adaptation-and-mitigation-plan" target="blank">drafting</a> a Climate Change Act. However, since this mention of the Act in Parliament, it has not been discussed further.</li>
                    <li>That said, the PAP government has made several encouraging commitments to tackle climate change. In Budget 2020, Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat <a href="https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/budget-speech/d-sustaining-singapores-success-for-our-future-generations#s1" target="blank">detailed</a> several new national climate policies, including ambitious transport electrification, HDB Green Towns Programs, and a Coastal Protection Fund. In 2016, the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) published a paper <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/docs/default-source/publications/take-action-today-for-a-carbon-efficient-singapore.pdf" target="blank">detailing</a> various business- and household-centred policies to “Improve Energy and Carbon Efficiency, Reduce Emissions in Power Generation, Deploy Low-Carbon Technology, and Encourage Collective Climate Action.”</li>
                    <li>The creation of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC) within the Prime Minister’s Office in 2007 reflects a Whole-of-Government approach to climate change. The <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/who-we-are/inter-ministerial-committee-on-climate-change/" target="blank">IMCCC</a> was established to coordinate across governments to reduce our emissions and to prepare for the consequences of climate change.</li>
                    <li>Singapore also contributes to the reduction of emissions in the <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media-centre/parliamentary-replies/parliamentary-reply-by-senior-minister-teo-chee-hean-on-ministries-climate-compliance" target="blank">aviation</a> and <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media-centre/parliamentary-replies/parliamentary-reply-by-senior-minister-teo-chee-hean-on-ministries-climate-compliance" target="blank" >maritime</a> industry. Singapore sits on the council of the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-re-elected-to-international-maritime-organisation-council" target="blank">International Maritime Organisation</a> and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/singapore-re-elected-to-icao-council" target="blank">International Civil Aviation Organisation</a> to tackle international transport emissions. The PAP government has announced that it <a href="https://www.mot.gov.sg/news-centre/news/Detail/speech-by-senior-minister-of-state-for-transport-and-health-lam-pin-min-at-the-ministry-of-transport-s-committee-of-supply-debate-2020-sustainable-competitive-industries-and-sustainable-environment-with-a-focus-on-aviation-maritime-and-active-mobility/" target="blank">will participate in</a> (1) the voluntary phase of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to freeze carbon footprint, improve energy efficiency and study the use of sustainable aviation fuels, and (2) launch the Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint 2050 next year, placing $40 million under the Maritime GreenFuture Fund. </li>

                </h3>
                    <p>The SDP has made broad statements on the general insufficiency of existing climate financing, but has not provided concrete suggestions as to its own climate financing targets or ambitions. Admittedly, this is a difficult task, as explained below.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The SDP has <a href="https://cdn.yoursdp.org/s/asset//Policy-2019/Climate-change-policy-2020.pdf" target="blank">suggested</a> that current spending on long-term adaptation measures will be insufficient if more emissions-reducing policies are not implemented in the near- or medium-term, indicating that it may be willing to spend more on mitigating climate change than the government’s present commitment (p.3)</li>
                    <li>However, this willingness is not clearly articulated or quantified.</li>
                    <li>Given that the current government’s spending on climate change is divided across multiple spending streams, as can be seen in Budget 2020, it will admittedly be difficult for opposition parties to put a figure to their suggested spending on climate change. Since climate change is the crisis of this and future generations, it is imperative that an open conversation on mitigation expenditure is facilitated by a comprehensive disclosure on current climate spending by the incumbent.</li>

Other communities, such as individuals with limited access to cooling (migrant workers in dormitories, low-income households, domestic workers with limited agency), or households that will have to combat rising food prices have not been addressed in any plan/policy.</li>

It unfairly puts the burden on younger and future generations that have contributed much less to the climate crisis.</li>

                        The party does not articulate how the climate crisis may disproportionately harm existing marginalised groups, save for remarks on food prices. More broadly, however, the party has acknowledged Singapore’s complicity in destructive practices like sand mining and the financing of corporations that perpetuate transboundary haze.
                        Additionally, the party has chastised Singapore’s prevailing economic growth model, linking it to other socio-political injustices like wealth inequality and migrant rights. While the party has denounced rising xenophobia in Singapore, it remains to be seen how the party will tackle this issue.

                        <li>The party recognises complicity in the issue of transboundary haze, saying: “Singapore should be banned from investing in or financing corporations that have been found to be involved, directly or otherwise, in the burning of forests in Indonesia and Malaysia”. This point, and the previous one, demonstrate SDP’s awareness of extractivism, intersectionality and power dynamics (p.22).</li>
                        <li>The party has also linked Singapore’s population growth targets to climate issues like the continuous need to reclaim land, the worsening of the urban heat island effect, and our ability to adapt to rising sea levels (p.7,19).</li>
                        <li>While the party clarifies that it “welcomes foreign workers into our economy”, suggests that a minimum wage should be applied to all workers, and asserts that Singapore “must ensure that Singaporeans do not embrace ugly nationalism and xenophobia,” no proposals are raised for tackling this phenomenon (p.20).</li>

                    <p>
                        The SPP has made several proposals aimed at social justice, including greater support for mental health, removal of ethnic housing quotas, and assistance for households with children and aging parents. However, the party has not articulated how the climate crisis will harm these vulnerable groups, and how this may be addressed.

                        <li>The SPP suggests that the government should improve the accessibility of mental healthcare by making them available at all government healthcare institutions, subsidising them, and sentencing offenders with mental health issues to treatment rather than punishment (15).</li>
                        <li>The party advocates abolishing ethnic quotas as they “may be prohibitive to sellers from minority races looking to sell their HDB flats” (17).</li>
                        <li>The party proposes instituting ‘Parentcare leave’ and increasing childcare and parent care tax reliefs for low-income brackets (12,13).</li>

                    <p>
                        The Reform Party’s climate policies reflect an awareness of how Singapore’s policies affect our neighboring countries and our migrant worker population disproportionately. However, there is no clear articulation of how more vulnerable communities will be protected through their climate policies.

                        <li>The Reform Party notes that “many of the migrant workers we rely on are from countries most affected by our damaging activities”. </li>
                        <li>It also calls for “better wages for foreign workers”. </li>
                        <li>Additionally, the Reform Party acknowledges that Singapore’s policies might have created damage on “other nations.”  </li>
                        <li>However, they have also stated that the “sand we take away from coastlines for national construction work [...] causes rising sea levels in those countries.” This is incorrect and inaccurate information. The more sand is taken away, the lower the water flow, which translates to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/feb/27/sand-mining-global-environmental-crisis-never-heard" target="blank">lower water quality and supply</a>. This false information, coupled with the Reform Party lifting a significant amount of their policies from the Greenwatch Policy Brief, raises doubts as to the amount of research that was done for this manifesto beforehand.                        </li>

                        While energy efficiency measures have been widely adopted, overall energy demand is still projected to rise until about 2030. Singapore’s consumption of electricity has been rising year-on-year since at least 2012. Looking to the future, electricity demand is still expected to rise until at least 2030. Much of this demand comes from the industry sector.

                    <p>Progress on regional collaboration remains slow and mooted in the distant future. That said, the PAP government has been working towards increasing its solar capacity and installing solar panels on HDB rooftops. However, this still fulfils only a small percentage of Singapore’s energy needs.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Progress on collaboration with regional partners, in particular through the ASEAN Power Grid, remains slow in spite of the massive endowment of renewable resources in the region. Most of the headway made has been limited to the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/establishing-multilateral-power-trade-in-asean" target="blank">bilateral development of transmission infrastructure and trade.</a></li>
                        <li>Even with the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/establishing-multilateral-power-trade-in-asean" target="blank">Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS–PIP)</a>, a “pathfinder” multilateral power trading project, the PAP government appears lukewarm in its commitment. As it stands today, the LTMS–PIP involves only the sale of electricity from Lao PDR to Malaysia, with Thailand acting as a transit country.</li>
                        <li>There has been, nonetheless, some progress on this front. The PAP government has announced the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/20b-plan-to-supply-solar-power-from-australia-to-spore" target="blank">Australia-Singapore Power Link</a>, a long distance solar transmission project with Australia mooted for 2030. The Australia-Singapore Power Link is projected to supply a fifth of Singapore's power needs, helping to ease its dependence on imported liquefied natural gas.   </li>
                        <li>The PAP government has also announced a <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/press-releases/30122019-ccg_mrp-hdb-increases-solar-target-from-220-mwp" target="blank">2GWp target for solar energy by 2030</a> (equivalent to 10% of Singapore’s peak daily electricity demand), with plans to fit <a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Speeches/2019/10/Speech-by-Minister-Chan-Chun-Sing-at-the-12th-Singapore-International-Energy-Week-2019" target="blank">one in two HDB rooftops with solar panels</a> over the upcoming years.

                        <li>However, the PAP government will not provide subsidies to solar electricity generators <a href="https://www.reach.gov.sg/-/media/reach/reach-files/public-consultations/2020/nccs/public-consultation-on-developing-singapores-long-term-low-emissions-strategy/annex-for-singapores-leds-public-consultation-response.ashx" target="blank">for fear that it will distort the market price signal.</a></li>

                    <p>The PAP government has given mixed messages on the future of fossil fuels. They have recognised that fossil fuels have a limited role in Singapore’s long term energy needs, but haven’t said anything concrete about disavowing the fossil fuel industry.

                        <li>Minister for Trade and Industry (MTI) Chan Chun Sing has said that Singapore is <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/the-will-to-defy-the-odds-of-history" target="blank">“thinking of a future away from fossil fuels”</a>, but has also said that natural gas will remain the dominant energy source for the next <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/natural-gas-to-remain-spores-key-energy-fuel-for-50-years" target="blank">50 years</a>. Worryingly, the faith that oil giants such as <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/02/09/exxonmobil-gambles-on-growth" target="blank">Exxonmobil</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shell-climate-exclusive/exclusive-no-choice-but-to-invest-in-oil-shell-ceo-says-idUSKBN1WT2JL" target="blank">Shell</a> are also thinking of a future beyond fossil fuel seems misplaced.

                        The Reform Party has not articulated a proposal on how Singapore as a whole can transition away from fossil fuels.

                        <li>The Reform Party did however  “propose that our Sovereign Wealth Funds, … commit to ceasing investments in fossil fuel and other damaging industries, and change the weighting of their portfolios to a majority investment in low carbon industry by 2025.”. However, this is not an all-encompassing plan to remove Singapore’s reliance on fossil fuel. We have thus accounted for this in the Industry section instead. </li>

        <p>By putting a price on carbon emissions, we ensure that the price of fossil fuels includes the cost of climate disruption and leverage the capacity of the market to enable emissions reductions. That said, carbon pricing is not a silver bullet and must be accompanied by other ambitious policies. Carbon pricing can be evaluated in three aspects: 1) Price 2) Coverage of carbon emitting institutions 3) How the carbon tax revenue is used. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The current and projected carbon tax rates are highly insufficient. Currently, the carbon tax is set at <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/climate-change-and-singapore/reducing-emissions/carbon-tax" target="blank">$5 per tonne of Carbon Dioxide emitted for industrial facilities that emit over 25,000 tCO2e</a>. Singapore <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/climate-change/carbon-tax" target="blank">will review</a> the carbon tax rate by 2023, with plans to increase it to between $10 and $15 per tonne of GHG emissions by 2030. </li>
                        <li>Although there is no single ideal carbon price out there as that is dependent on the country’s energy mix and climate policies, Singapore’s current and targeted rates are still clearly too low. Numerous figures have been proposed as guidelines for an “optimal” carbon price. <a href="https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/news/2017/5/25/leading-economists-a-strong-carbon-price-needed-to-drive-large-scale-climate-action" target="blank">A report</a> by the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices, chaired by Joseph Stiglitz and Lord Nicholas Stern, recommends that a tax of at least US$40–80 per tonne by 2020, rising to US$50–100 in 2030 is necessary in order to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement.</li>
                        <li>In a book titled “The Climate Casino” by pioneering environmental economist William Nordhaus where he analysed 13 models on carbon prices, he found an average carbon price of approximately US$30 per tonne in 2020 rising to US$55 in 2030 is necessary in order to keep to a 2.5°C target. His own economic modelling of the social costs of climate change, suggests an “optimal” scenario of 3.5°C of warming in 2100, where the 2015 social cost of carbon is US$30 per tonne, rising to US$42 in 2025. Adjusting the model to a 2.5°C warming projection, by contrast, brings this social cost of carbon upwards of US$200 per tonne from 2020 onwards.</li>
                        <li>Others suggest that the carbon price should be pitched at a level that incentivises utilising carbon capture technologies, which optimistic estimates say are possible at least <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/its-possible-to-reverse-climate-change-suggests-major-new-study/562289/" target="blank">US$100 per tonne.</a></li>
                        <li>Further, there is a lack of information on how the carbon tax rates were decided and how they will contribute to emissions reductions.</li>

                    <p>The Carbon Pricing Act charges by facilities, not entities, leaving a loophole that allows corporations to get away with having many emitting facilities which individual emissions level falls below the minimum level required for them to be taxed. That said, Singapore’s carbon tax is commendable in the sense that it is applied to all sectors without exemptions and covers 80% of Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

                        <li>The Carbon Pricing Act does not extend to all companies with emitting industrial facilities. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14rLFJ6- OLpHWttVH0NSLfnvawKGKeTb2/view" target="blank">Only facilities with more than a given amount (25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year) are taxed. “Facility” refers to a single factory or infrastructure, rather than a company which is known as an “entity”</a>. This means a larger company with two smaller facilities that do not exceed the stated emissions limit individually will not be taxed. On the contrary, a smaller company with one facility over the stated emissions limit will be taxed even though the total emissions of the first company is higher than the second.</li>
                        <li>That said, the carbon tax is <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/carbon-tax-will-affect-mainly-large-polluters" target="blank">implemented uniformly to all sectors, without exemption</a>. This is commendable, given that in several countries, the carbon tax comes with an exemption to certain pollutive industries.</li>

                    <p>It is unclear if or how the revenues are redistributed to citizens. The carbon tax revenue should be progressively redistributed to households according to needs.

                        <li>It is unclear if or how the carbon tax revenue is redistributed to citizens. As of yet, the PAP government has shared that it expects to collect a carbon tax revenue of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/carbon-tax-will-affect-mainly-large-polluters" target="blank">nearly $1 billion over</a> the first five years. Revenues will be used to fund green initiatives via two existing schemes: the Productivity Grant (Energy Efficiency) and the Energy Efficiency Fund. This includes measures by industry to reduce emissions and providing measures to ease the transition.</li>
                        <li>The impact on households has been estimated to be <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-budget-2018-carbon-tax-of-5-per-tonne-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-be-levied" target="blank">about 1% point increase in total electricity and gas expenses on average.</a> <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-budget-2018-carbon-tax-of-5-per-tonne-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-be-levied" target="blank">Households will get help in the form of additional utilities rebates</a> through the GST Voucher U-Save scheme. Eligible HDB households will each receive $20 more per year for three years, which will cover the expected average increase in electricity and gas expenses for HDB households arising from the carbon tax.</li>
                        <li>By not legislating that the progressive redistribution of the carbon tax revenue, this excludes citizens from having a stake in a policy that affects their daily lives and also leaves the continuity of the offsetting rebates completely to the PAP government’s discretion.</li>

                        <li>Minister Chan Chun Sing has further <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/exxonmobil-to-expand-singapore-manufacturing-complex-jurong-11405298" target="blank">endorsed</a> ExxonMobil as a “close and trusted partner” of Singapore, and <a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Speeches/2019/10/Speech-by-Minister-Chan-Chun-Sing-at-the-12th-Singapore-International-Energy-Week-2019" target="blank">affirmed</a> the PAP government's plans to grow Singapore as an LNG hub</li>
                        <li>The PAP government’s support of the petrochemical industry is longstanding. For instance, in 2017, Keppel <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/keppel-signs-deal-with-edb-to-build-gasification-plant-on-jurong-island" target="blank">signed</a> a deal with the Economic Development Board (EDB) to build a gasification plant on Jurong Island.

                        <li>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2019/green-finance-for-a-sustainable-world" target="blank">announced</a> that it will introduce, in 2020, Environmental Risk Management (ENRM) guidelines across the financial sector to set standards on governance, risk management, and disclosure. While this has the potential to discourage investments in fossil fuel assets, details on the guidelines are still pending.</li>
                        <li>The extent to which the PAP government intends to enforce these standards is also unclear. Amy Khor has <a href="https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=oral-answer-2081" target="blank">said</a> that the PAP government “does not interfere or influence [businesses and financial institutions’] individual investment decisions” in response to parliamentary questions about the financing of fossil fuel plants outside Singapore.</li>
                        <li>Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung has stated that the MAS has been “<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/2019/reply-to-cos-cuts-on-gems-corporate-governance-and-sustainable-financing" target="blank">actively working</a> with [its] fund managers” to ensure that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are incorporated into its own investment portfolio, but has not released further details.</li>
                        <li>Several local banks, namely OCBC Bank and DBS Bank, have announced that they will cease financing new coal-fired power plants in any market. However, this is often with the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/dbs-to-cease-financing-of-new-coal-power-plants" target="blank">condition</a> that they continue on and complete current fossil fuel projects which nevertheless <a href="https://www.eco-business.com/news/ngos-urge-dbs-pull-out-of-risky-indonesian-coal-power-deal/" target="blank">result</a> in significant pollution.</li>

                    </h3>
                    <p>The PAP government has yet to articulate a clear road map that coordinates both public and private actions towards making Singapore a hub for green finance, despite having signalled its support for green investments to turn Singapore into a green finance and circular economy hub. There is also a need to harmonise standards and clarify what the PAP government considers to be “green” or “sustainable”.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <h3 class="title is-4">Elaboration</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>According to the NCCS*, the PAP government aims to make Singapore a green finance hub and to develop a circular economy, in which low-carbon and sustainable solutions are to be test-bedded and exported globally. These efforts are intended not only “to grow [Singapore’s] economy and create more jobs for Singaporeans, but also allow [Singapore] to support abatement efforts beyond our shores”. However, the PAP government has yet to produce a clear road map articulating how and when these ambitions will be realised.</li>
                        <li>In 2017, the MAS <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2019/green-finance-for-a-sustainable-world" target="blank">launched</a> the Green Bond Grant Scheme to catalyse the green bond market, under which eligible expenses for obtaining an external review for green bonds would be fully funded, subject to a cap. In February 2019, the grant scheme was <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/schemes-and-initiatives/sustainable-bond-grant-scheme" target="blank">expanded</a> to include social and sustainability bonds, and renamed as the Sustainable Bond Grant (SBG) Scheme. The minimum issuance size requirement was lowered and the grant scheme was extended to end May 2023.</li>
                        <li>In November 2019, the MAS further <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/green-finance-led-spore-can-help-mobilise-global-action-against-climate-change-ong-ye-kung" target="blank">announced</a> a US$2 billion green investments programme (GIP) to support “public market investment strategies that have a strong green focus”. The first investment under the GIP will be a US$100m placement in the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) Green Bond Investment Pool (GBIP).</li>
                        <li>Devoting more investment into sustainable initiatives is a welcome move, and the PAP government appears committed to mobilising more capital to drive low-carbon solutions. However, more standardisation and clarification are needed as to what projects are counted as “green”.</li>

        <p>The land transport sector accounts for about 14% of Singapore’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and is mostly powered by vehicles that run on petroleum. Thus, Singapore urgently needs to reduce car use and convert all vehicles to clean energy in order to reduce emissions from this sector.</p>

                        <li>Singapore’s high car ownership is in spite of the current Vehicle Growth Rate (VGR) for categories A, B and D (cars and motorcycles) being set at <a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2017/10/2/certificate-of-entitlement-quota-for-november-2017-to-january-2018-and-vehicle-growth-rate-from-february-2018.html" target="blank">0% until 1Q 2021</a>.

All cars should be treated as a single category, as many other cities do, as their carbon emissions per person are significantly higher compared to public transport, cycling or walking. For example, by 2041, London <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/mayors-transport-strategy-2018.pdf" target="blank">plans</a> to have 80% walk, cycle, public transport mode share (not including taxis/PHV).</li>

The public transport mode share is still lower than other cities like Hong Kong and Seoul though there are plans to increase the rail density to be comparable to London and New York City.

                        <li>The same holds for those aged over 65, and also for those with special needs or for those with other conditions that make it difficult to drive, as well as their carers.</li>
                        <li>The RP also thinks that our streets should be redesigned “..for safe family oriented cycle routes…” They also advocate for cycle highways, presumably to facilitate bike commuting, as well as a “provision of free parking for cycles”. </li>
                        <li>However, we note that the party has only talked about buses in relation to public transport. We are unsure about their stance on MRTs. In addition, we are uncertain of what the party means by a “provision of free parking for cycles” and how that particular proposal adds value to the existing situation for bicycle parking. </li>

                        The SDP proposed clear policies for full electrification of vehicles before the government announced its plans in the 2020 budget. The proposals are similar, including leading the transition with taxis and buses, incentives for private car owners to switch, and mass expansion of EV charging points.

People have called for the PAP government <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/liberal-education-makes-for-better-citizens-nmp" target="blank">to expand</a> liberal education in Singapore so as to develop more critical Singaporeans.</li>
                        <li>Though contentious, Singapore ranks low on the <a href="https://www.mci.gov.sg/pressroom/news-and-stories/pressroom/2004/11/mcis-response-to-pq-on-press-freedom" target="blank">world press freedom ranking report</a>.</li>

The “<a href="https://www.nyc.gov.sg/en/initiatives/grants/national-youth-fund/" target="blank">National Youth Fund</a> (NYF) supports ground-up youth initiatives to champion community and social causes through partnerships with Youth Sector Organisations (YSO) including youth social enterprises, schools, Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) and other community partners.”, <a href="https://www.mccy.gov.sg/sparkthenext" target="blank">SG Youth Action Plan</a> with "up to $50,000 in grants to support youth-led innovations", and a $50 million <a href="https://www.mewr.gov.sg/news/new-sg-eco-office-and-50-million-sg-eco-fund-to-promote-environmental-sustainability-in-communities" target="blank">SG Eco Fund</a> to support sustainability projects that nudge people and communities towards environmentally-friendly behaviour.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, the PAP government has historically <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mps-respond-to-climate-rallygoers-ideas" target="blank">praised and affirmed</a> various ground-up movements</li>

                        <li>The WP has consistently asked for <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-wp-chief-calls-for-universal-senior-citizen-healthcare-package-and-more-open" target="blank">better transparency and freedom of information</a> and pointed out the information asymmetry between the government and citizens, and have also called for <a href="http://theindependent.sg/wps-leon-perera-again-proposes-live-streaming-of-parliamentary-proceedings/" target="blank">full live streaming</a> for all Parliament sittings.</li>
                        <li>In his <a href="https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=budget-1291" target="blank">Bold Green Agenda Speech in the 2020 Budget Debates</a>, Dennis Tan advocated for the NCCS to “consider working with public and private research agencies and researchers on this [climate change] so that easy-to-access facts and evidence on climate change can be in the public domain.” </li>
                        <li>In a <a href="https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=written-answer-5275" target="blank">2019 parliamentary question</a>, Pritam Singh asked MEWR if “the NEA life cycle assessment study on plastics be made public in its entirety for the use of academics, professionals and the lay public so as to promote an evidence-based approach to climate solutions suited for the Singapore context.”</li>
                        <li>During the second reading of the <a href="https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=bill-248" target="blank">2018 Carbon Pricing Bill</a>, Leon Perera asked if the Government would consider making data on individual large emitters' emissions publicly available. He argued that doing so “would nudge emitters to do better reduce their emissions” and would also allow researchers the “opportunity to access data to track Singapore's progress to meeting our commitments under the Paris Agreement, and to scrutinise the effectiveness of the carbon tax and other green measures amongst other possibilities.” </li>
                        <li>In his <a href="https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=budget-1322">2020 COS Speech</a>, WP MP Daniel Goh recommended that it should be required that Government bodies and large companies conduct annual carbon auditing. He argued that carbon auditing can help organisations “understand their greenhouse inventory, isolate each emission source, and hence, determine and model emission reduction strategies, their payback and viability”. He also advocated for carbon auditing subsidies for companies for the next 10 years. </li>
                        <li>In its <a href="https://d3bnzwrhehvhbjiwmja.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/The+Workers+Party+Manifesto+2020.pdf" target="blank">2020 GE Manifesto</a>, the WP also stated that “CPF members must be given transparency on the nature and performance of their money” (13). Additionally, the party also believes that “Documents in the National Archives that are declassified after 25 years from the date of record should be made freely accessible to all.” “This will ensure greater transparency and accountability, and lead to a better understanding of our history” (34).</li>

                        he Reform Party’s stance on educating the public on climate issues is unclear. They did propose public education to “encourage reduction and a new relationship to rampant consumerism.”, however there are no more details beyond that. Since that proposal was given in the context of dealing with waste, we have thus accounted for that statement in the Waste section instead.

                    <p>Singapore has long prioritised economic gains over environmental protection. Increases in green spaces are mostly attributed to urban greening. Huge imports of sand has also led to the destruction of natural spaces in other countries.Where biodiversity has been lost within Singapore, there has been some effort put into restoring or re-establishing lost species and natural ecosystems. Some targets related to reporting carbon stock and carbon flux in vegetation and land use, restoring selected ecosystems and tree planting have been set.</p>

                    <p>The SDP’s climate policy argues that forests and natural areas should be prioritized. Instead, other spaces such as golf courses should be gazetted for development.

                        <li>Based on the SDP’s plan, “forests in Singapore would be left undisturbed and HDB estates would, instead, replace existing golf courses. Given the scarcity of land in Singapore, golf courses reserved for the recreation of the wealthy few make little sense” (p.19). </li>
                        <li>SDP recommends “targeting the commercial entities responsible for the fires” in Indonesia and Malaysia, signalling stronger future responses towards forest burning. The SDP also criticizes the lack of enforcement and prosecution towards companies in Singapore who have flouted the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act and have contributed to haze pollution. As such, they intend to “aggressively enforce the THPA to bring business entities that are involved with forest-burning companies to heel” (p.22). </li>

        <p>Although waste makes up a small proportion of Singapore’s total emissions through its incineration, when we account for the entire carbon footprint involved in creating new products, reducing waste can result in substantial emission reductions. Relatively more significant sources of carbon emissions come from hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and food waste.</p>

The implementation of an RFID-based food waste collection and charging system in Songpa district in Seoul <a href="https://www.koreaexpose.com/banchan-south-korea-food-waste/" target="blank">reduced food waste by 25 percent from 2012 to 2017.</a></li>

It will also lay the foundation for an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework for managing packaging waste, that will be implemented no later than 2025. However, the reporting framework ultimately still attempts to only incentivise companies to reduce waste, instead of having binding regulations that would force businesses to take action, such as example a plastic bag tax.</li>

                        The SPP calls for the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme to be expanded to include all waste streams, a minor but notable contribution to existing efforts.

                        There is recognition that waste reduction requires a reduction in consumption, rather than individual acts such as reducing plastic straws. The Reform Party also suggests introducing composting to further reduce waste. However, they stopped short of articulating concrete policies.

        <p>Buildings account for a significant proportion of Singapore’s carbon emissions throughout their lifecycle: in the embodied carbon of their materials, their energy use, demolition and the high global warming potential of the refrigerants used in air conditioning. Due to their long lifespan, immediate action is needed to avoid the lock-in of high emission buildings that will be in use for decades to come.</p>

                    <p>Green building standards need to be drastically improved and aligned with net-zero targets that include emissions from the energy they consume while in use as well as those embodied in their materials. Singapore has its own green building certification standards and various policies in place including R&D grants and financial incentives to support the development of green buildings, but this is insufficient to meet the above targets.</p>

                        <li>BCA’s Super Low Energy Building Technology Roadmap only leads to a 60-80% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030, with no target for achieving net-zero energy buildings This is in spite of the World Green Building Council’s (WGBC) call for all new and existing buildings to achieve net zero operational energy by 2050.</li>
                        <li>Minimal focus has been put into achieving net zero embodied carbon, which accounts for the carbon footprint of all materials used in the entire process from construction to operational. Only <a href="https://www.bca.gov.sg/GreenMark/others/3rd_Green_Building_Masterplan.pdf" target="blank">a small fraction</a> of the total points available in the Green Mark system are awarded for using low carbon materials. Again, the WGBC has called for all new buildings to achieve net zero embodied carbon by 2050 but Singapore is far from reaching this goal.</li>
                        <li>That said, Singapore has made notable progress in the development of green buildings such as <a href="https://www.reach.gov.sg/-/media/reach/reach-files/public-consultations/2020/nccs/public-consultation-on-developing-singapores-long-term-low-emissions-strategy/annex-for-singapores-leds-public-consultation-response.ashx" target="blank">greening 40% of all buildings</a> with a target of 80% by 2030, publishing energy performance data for all buildings, <a href="https://www.mewr.gov.sg/news/oral-reply-by-senior-minister-of-state-for-the-environment-and-water-resources-dr-amy-khor-to-parliamentary-question-on-carbon-emissions-on-4-nov-2019" taregt="blank">encouraging households</a> to <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/climate-friendly-household-package-to-help-households" target="blank">purchase</a> energy-efficient appliances, <a href="https://www.bca.gov.sg/GreenMark/others/3rd_Green_Building_Masterplan.pdf" target="blank">supporting green building advancement</a> in the region, and leading with the <a href="https://www.mnd.gov.sg/our-work/greening-our-home/bca-green-mark" target="blank">public sector</a>.</li>

                    <p>The SDP has identified air conditioning as a major source of emissions, and proposes designing for natural ventilation to mitigate it.

                        <li>The SDP will adopt criteria to assess future development projects under a ‘Green Concept Building Plan’, including: minimal disturbance to landscapes and site condition, use of non-toxic and recycled/recyclable material, efficient use of water and water recycling, use of energy-efficient and eco-friendly types of equipment, use of renewable energy, quality of indoor air quality for human safety and comfort, effective controls and building management systems. (p.27)</li>
                        <li>The party also plans to design buildings with natural cooling techniques in place such as cross-ventilation and using appropriate materials in order to reduce the energy carbon emissions required for cooling the interior of buildings. (p.27)</li>
                        <li>However, these changes are suggested to cut energy consumption by only 30%. This is still far from meeting net-zero targets towards construction, which the party has no suggestions to achieve in the policy paper.</li>

                    <p>Singapore has not ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement that will help to reduce the production and consumption of HFCs. However, it has put in place a mandatory labeling scheme to encourage households and building owners to select appliances that utilise ‘climate friendly’ refrigerants. There is also a planned grant to encourage buildings to use climate-friendly refrigerants and to phase out refrigeration and air conditioning (RAC) equipment that use high-global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, and building capacity and mandating the proper decommissioning of RAC equipment.</p>
