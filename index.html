                            <p>Our ‘reductions target’ constitutes an absolute emissions increase until 2030, which does not meet our commitment to reduce emissions as soon as possible. A continued increase in emissions until 2030 fails to model a pathway to the IPCC target for 1.5 degree warming.</p>

                                <h3 class="title is-4">Elaboration</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Singapore’s 2020 update to its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), our emissions target, does not change the level of carbon emissions we aim for in 2030. <a href="https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Singapore%20First/Singapore%20INDC.pdf" target="blank">In 2015</a>, Singapore targeted reducing emissions as a factor of GDP by 36% (below 2005 levels), by 2030. At the time, the 2030 target was estimated to be 65 MTCO2e based on projected GDP growth. <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/speeches/speech-by-senior-minister-and-coordinating-minister-for-national-security-teo-chee-hean-committee-of-supply-2020-28-february-2020" target="_blank">In 2020</a>, Singapore targeted an absolute peak emission level of 65 MtCO2e around 2030. The 2015 and 2020 targets are similar.</li>
                                    <li>The updated target of 65 MTCO2e by 2030 is ~28% above <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-inventory" target="blank">2014 emissions</a> of 50.9 MTCO2e. Singapore needs to considerably improve its reduction target.</li>
                                    <li>The second part of the new NDC, which aims to reach half of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/spores-2050-target-halve-emissions-from-2030-peak" target="blank">2030's emissions by 2050</a>, also lacks ambition. Half of 2030 emissions (65 MtCO2e) is 33 MtCO2e, which would mean only a return to 1997 emission levels according to <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/singapore/" target="blank">Climate Action Tracker’s data.</a> In order to keep global warming to within 1.5 degrees celsius, net global emissions <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/" target="blank">need</a> to reach 0 MtCO2e by 2050</li>
                                    <li>There appears to be no desire to meet the IPCC target for 1.5 degree warming. PM Lee Hsien Loong has declared that it is <a href="https://mothership.sg/2020/03/pm-lee-covid-19-interview-transcript/" target="blank">not practical</a> for Singapore to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</li>

                            <p>To achieve more ambitious targets, a coordinated government approach, informed by a legally binding climate change legislation, must be adopted. While current policies by various ministries constitute a clear effort to meet current targets, these targets are insufficient.</p>

                                    <li>In Parliament in 2019, PAP MP Dr Lim Wee Kiak <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/day-2-budget-debate-mps-ask-easy-access-data-and-climate-change-act" target="blank">said</a> that “Singapore should consider enacting a Climate Change Act” which legally binds the country to meeting its climate targets. Countries like <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/tackling-climate-change/the-legal-landscape/the-climate-change-act/" target="blank">Britain</a> and <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/climate-change-act/id2593351/" target="blank">Norway</a> have put in place a Climate Change act; Malaysia has been <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/05/16/yeo-at-least-24-months-for-climate-change-act-to-be-tabled-if-necessary/1753644" target="blank">scoping</a> and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-to-draft-climate-change-act-formulate-national-adaptation-and-mitigation-plan" target="blank">drafting</a> a Climate Change Act. However, since this mention of the Act in Parliament, it has not been discussed further.</li>
                                    <li>That said, the government has made several encouraging commitments to tackle climate change. In Budget 2020, Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat <a href="https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/budget-speech/d-sustaining-singapores-success-for-our-future-generations#s1" target="blank">detailed</a> several new national climate policies, including ambitious transport electrification, HDB Green Towns Programs, and a Coastal Protection Fund. In 2016, the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) published a paper <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/docs/default-source/publications/take-action-today-for-a-carbon-efficient-singapore.pdf" target="blank">detailing</a> various business- and household-centred policies to “Improve Energy and Carbon Efficiency, Reduce Emissions in Power Generation, Deploy Low-Carbon Technology, and Encourage Collective Climate Action.”</li>
                                    <li>The creation of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC) within the Prime Minister’s Office in 2007 reflects a Whole-of-Government approach to climate change. The <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/who-we-are/inter-ministerial-committee-on-climate-change/" target="blank">IMCCC</a> was established to coordinate across governments to reduce our emissions and to prepare for the consequences of climate change.
                                    <li>Singapore also contributes to the reduction of emissions in the <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media-centre/parliamentary-replies/parliamentary-reply-by-senior-minister-teo-chee-hean-on-ministries-climate-compliance" target="blank">aviation</a> and <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media-centre/parliamentary-replies/parliamentary-reply-by-senior-minister-teo-chee-hean-on-ministries-climate-compliance" target="blank">maritime</a> industry. Singapore sits on the council of the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-re-elected-to-international-maritime-organisation-council" target="blank">International Maritime Organisation</a> and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/singapore-re-elected-to-icao-council" target="blank">International Civil Aviation Organisation</a> to tackle international transport emissions. The government <a href="https://www.mot.gov.sg/news-centre/news/Detail/speech-by-senior-minister-of-state-for-transport-and-health-lam-pin-min-at-the-ministry-of-transport-s-committee-of-supply-debate-2020-sustainable-competitive-industries-and-sustainable-environment-with-a-focus-on-aviation-maritime-and-active-mobility/" target="blank">will participate in</a> (1) the voluntary phase of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to freeze carbon footprint, improve energy efficiency and study the use of sustainable aviation fuels, and (2) launch the Maritime Singapore Decarbonisation Blueprint 2050 next year, placing $40 million under the Maritime GreenFuture Fund.

                            <p>It would be more effective for the government to dedicate a portion of the annual national budget to climate mitigation or adaptation measures, under a centralised body responsible for disbursing these funds. Such a structure would improve the transparency and coordination of these efforts. As of now, the government has been investing large amounts in areas that it has pledged to tackle: Energy Efficiency, Solar Capacity, Green Finance, Electrification, and Adaptation.  </p>
