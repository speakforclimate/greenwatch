                                    <li>Singapore’s 2020 update to its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), our emissions target, does not change the level of carbon emissions we aim for in 2030. <a href="https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Singapore%20First/Singapore%20INDC.pdf" target="blank">In 2015</a>, Singapore targeted reducing emissions as a factor of GDP by 36% (below 2005 levels), by 2030. At the time, the 2030 target was estimated to be 65 MTCO2e based on projected GDP growth. <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/speeches/speech-by-senior-minister-and-coordinating-minister-for-national-security-teo-chee-hean-committee-of-supply-2020-28-february-2020" target="_blank">In 2020</a>, Singapore targeted an absolute peak emission level of 65 MtCO2e around 2030. The 2015 and 2020 targets are similar.</li>
                                    <li>The updated target of 65 MTCO2e by 2030 is ~28% above <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-inventory" target="blank">2014 emissions</a> of 50.9 MTCO2e. Singapore needs to considerably improve its reduction target.</li>
                                    <li>The second part of the new NDC, which aims to reach half of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/spores-2050-target-halve-emissions-from-2030-peak" target="blank">2030's emissions by 2050</a>, also lacks ambition. Half of 2030 emissions (65 MtCO2e) is 33 MtCO2e, which would mean only a return to 1997 emission levels according to <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/singapore/" target="blank">Climate Action Tracker’s data.</a> In order to keep global warming to within 1.5 degrees celsius, net global emissions <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/" target="blank">need</a> to reach 0 MtCO2e by 2050</li>
                                    <li>There appears to be no desire to meet the IPCC target for 1.5 degree warming. PM Lee Hsien Loong has declared that it is <a href="https://mothership.sg/2020/03/pm-lee-covid-19-interview-transcript/" target="blank">not practical</a> for Singapore to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</li>

                            <p>To achieve more ambitious targets, a coordinated government approach, informed by a legally binding climate change legislation, must be adopted. While current policies by various ministries constitute a clear effort to meet current targets, these targets are insufficient.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>In Parliament in 2019, PAP MP Dr Lim Wee Kiak <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/day-2-budget-debate-mps-ask-easy-access-data-and-climate-change-act" target="blank">said</a> that “Singapore should consider enacting a Climate Change Act” which legally binds the country to meeting its climate targets. Countries like <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/tackling-climate-change/the-legal-landscape/the-climate-change-act/" target="blank">Britain</a> and <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/climate-change-act/id2593351/" target="blank">Norway</a> have put in place a Climate Change act; Malaysia has been <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/05/16/yeo-at-least-24-months-for-climate-change-act-to-be-tabled-if-necessary/1753644" target="blank">scoping</a> and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-to-draft-climate-change-act-formulate-national-adaptation-and-mitigation-plan" target="blank">drafting</a> a Climate Change Act. However, since this mention of the Act in Parliament, it has not been discussed further.</li>
                                    <li>That said, the government has made several encouraging commitments to tackle climate change. In Budget 2020, Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat <a href="https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/budget-speech/d-sustaining-singapores-success-for-our-future-generations#s1" target="blank">detailed</a> several new national climate policies, including ambitious transport electrification, HDB Green Towns Programs, and a Coastal Protection Fund. In 2016, the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) published a paper <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/docs/default-source/publications/take-action-today-for-a-carbon-efficient-singapore.pdf" target="blank">detailing</a> various business- and household-centred policies to “Improve Energy and Carbon Efficiency, Reduce Emissions in Power Generation, Deploy Low-Carbon Technology, and Encourage Collective Climate Action.”</li>
                                    <li>The creation of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC) within the Prime Minister’s Office in 2007 reflects a Whole-of-Government approach to climate change. The <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/who-we-are/inter-ministerial-committee-on-climate-change/" target="blank">IMCCC</a> was established to coordinate across governments to reduce our emissions and to prepare for the consequences of climate change.

                            <p>Progress on regional collaboration remains slow and mooted in the distant future. That said, the government has been working towards increasing its solar capacity and installing solar panels on HDB rooftops.

                                    <li>Progress on collaboration with regional partners, in particular through the ASEAN Power Grid, remains slow in spite of the massive endowment of renewable resources in the region. Most of the headway made has been limited to the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/establishing-multilateral-power-trade-in-asean" target="blank">bilateral development of transmission infrastructure and trade.</a></li>
                                    <li>Even with the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/establishing-multilateral-power-trade-in-asean" target="blank">Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS–PIP)</a>, a “pathfinder” multilateral power trading project, the Singapore government appears lukewarm in its commitment. As it stands today, the LTMS–PIP involves only the sale of electricity from Lao PDR to Malaysia, with Thailand acting as a transit country.</li>
                                    <li>There has been, nonetheless, some progress on this front. The government has announced the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/20b-plan-to-supply-solar-power-from-australia-to-spore" target="blank">Australia-Singapore Power Link</a>, a long distance solar transmission project with Australia mooted for 2030. The Australia-Singapore Power Link is projected to supply a fifth of Singapore's power needs, helping to ease its dependence on imported liquefied natural gas.   </li>
                                    <li>The Singapore government has also announced a <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/press-releases/30122019-ccg_mrp-hdb-increases-solar-target-from-220-mwp" target="blank">2GWp target for solar energy by 2030</a> (equivalent to 10% of Singapore’s peak daily electricity demand), with plans to fit <a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/Newsroom/Speeches/2019/10/Speech-by-Minister-Chan-Chun-Sing-at-the-12th-Singapore-International-Energy-Week-2019" target="blank">one in two HDB rooftops with solar panels</a> over the upcoming years.

                                    <li>The current and projected carbon tax rates are highly insufficient. Currently, the carbon tax is set at <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/climate-change-and-singapore/reducing-emissions/carbon-tax" target="blank">$5 per tonne of Carbon Dioxide emitted for industrial facilities that emit over 25,000 tCO2e</a>. Singapore <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/climate-change/carbon-tax" target="blank">will review</a> the carbon tax rate by 2023, with plans to increase it to between $10 and $15 per tonne of GHG emissions by 2030. </li>
                                    <li>Although there is no single ideal carbon price out there as that is dependent on the country’s energy mix and climate policies, Singapore’s current and targeted rates are still clearly too low. Numerous figures have been proposed as guidelines for an “optimal” carbon price. <a href="https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/news/2017/5/25/leading-economists-a-strong-carbon-price-needed-to-drive-large-scale-climate-action" target="blank">A report</a> by the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices, chaired by Joseph Stiglitz and Lord Nicholas Stern, recommends that a tax of at least US$40–80 per tonne by 2020, rising to US$50–100 in 2030 is necessary in order to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement.</li>
                                    <li>In a book titled “The Climate Casino” by pioneering environmental economist William Nordhaus where he analysed 13 models on carbon prices, he found an average carbon price of approximately US$30 per tonne in 2020 rising to US$55 in 2030 is necessary in order to keep to a 2.5°C target. His own economic modelling of the social costs of climate change, suggests an “optimal” scenario of 3.5°C of warming in 2100, where the 2015 social cost of carbon is US$30 per tonne, rising to US$42 in 2025. Adjusting the model to a 2.5°C warming projection, by contrast, brings this social cost of carbon upwards of US$200 per tonne from 2020 onwards.</li>
                                    <li>Others suggest that the carbon price should be pitched at a level that incentivises utilising carbon capture technologies, which optimistic estimates say are possible at least <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/its-possible-to-reverse-climate-change-suggests-major-new-study/562289/" target="blank">US$100 per tonne.</a></li>
                                    <li>Further, there is a lack of information on how the carbon tax rates were decided and how they will contribute to emissions reductions.</li>

                            <p>The Carbon Pricing Act charges by facilities, not entities, leaving a loophole that allows corporations to get away with having many emitting facilities which individual emissions level falls below the minimum level required for them to be taxed. That said, Singapore’s carbon tax is commendable in the sense that it is applied to all sectors without exemptions and covers 80% of Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

This means a larger company with two smaller facilities that do not exceed the stated emissions limit individually will not be taxed. On the contrary, a smaller company with one facility over the stated emissions limit will be taxed even though the total emissions of the first company is higher than the second.</li>

                                    <li>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2019/green-finance-for-a-sustainable-world" target="blank">announced</a> that it will introduce, in 2020, Environmental Risk Management (ENRM) guidelines across the financial sector to set standards on governance, risk management, and disclosure. While this has the potential to discourage investments in fossil fuel assets, details on the guidelines are still pending.</li>
                                    <li>The extent to which the government intends to enforce these standards is also unclear. Amy Khor has <a href="https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=oral-answer-2081" target="blank">said</a> that the government “does not interfere or influence [businesses and financial institutions’] individual investment decisions” in response to parliamentary questions about the financing of fossil fuel plants outside Singapore.</li>
                                    <li>Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung has stated that the MAS has been “<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/2019/reply-to-cos-cuts-on-gems-corporate-governance-and-sustainable-financing" target="blank">actively working</a> with [its] fund managers” to ensure that environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are incorporated into its own investment portfolio, but has not released further details.</li>
                                    <li>Several local banks, namely OCBC Bank and DBS Bank, have announced that they will cease financing new coal-fired power plants in any market. However, this is often with the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/dbs-to-cease-financing-of-new-coal-power-plants" target="blank">condition</a> that they continue on and complete current fossil fuel projects which nevertheless <a href="https://www.eco-business.com/news/ngos-urge-dbs-pull-out-of-risky-indonesian-coal-power-deal/" target="blank">result</a> in significant pollution.</li>

                                    <li>It is unclear if or how the carbon tax revenue is redistributed to citizens. As of yet, the government has shared that it expects to collect a carbon tax revenue of <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/carbon-tax-will-affect-mainly-large-polluters" target="blank">nearly $1 billion over</a> the first five years. Revenues will be used to fund green initiatives via two existing schemes: the Productivity Grant (Energy Efficiency) and the Energy Efficiency Fund. This includes measures by industry to reduce emissions and providing measures to ease the transition.</li>
                                    <li>The impact on households has been estimated to be <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-budget-2018-carbon-tax-of-5-per-tonne-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-be-levied" target="blank">about 1% point increase in total electricity and gas expenses on average.</a> <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-budget-2018-carbon-tax-of-5-per-tonne-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-be-levied" target="blank">Households will get help in the form of additional utilities rebates</a> through the GST Voucher U-Save scheme. Eligible HDB households will each receive $20 more per year for three years, which will cover the expected average increase in electricity and gas expenses for HDB households arising from the carbon tax.</li>
                                    <li>By not legislating that the progressive redistribution of the carbon tax revenue, this excludes citizens from having a stake in a policy that affects their daily lives and also leaves the continuity of the offsetting rebates completely to the government’s discretion.</li>
